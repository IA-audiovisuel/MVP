      " Comment expliquer les progrès phénoménaux que semble avoir accomplis l'intelligence artificielle au cours de ces dernières années. Depuis l'apparition de chat GPT en novembre 2022, rapidement suivi par d'autres agents conversationnels. Cette révolution technologique aux multiples aspects paraît désormais capable d'exécuter de nombreuses tâches intellectuelles sur lesquelles l'esprit humain pensait jusqu'à alors exercer un monopole. Écrire des articles, synthétiser des documents, traiter des données dans n'importe quel domaine, diagnostiquer une maladie, rédiger une dissertation, ou pourquoi pas, un scénario de film. Non contente de révolutionner le monde du travail, ses prouesses stupéfiantes de la technique soulèvent une interrogation majeure dans le domaine de la philosophie de l'esprit. Faut-il en déduire que l'intelligence, n'étant pas le propre d'un cerveau biologique et encore moins d'une âme, peut s'implémenter dans n'importe quelle machine, voir, comme s'inquiètent ou exultent certains, que l'IA sera un jour en mesure de remplacer notre conscience. À moins qu'il ne faille poser cette question à l'envers. Comment se fait-il que la machine puisse imiter les œuvres de de notre esprit. Comment est-il possible en d'autres termes que notre vie mentale se révèle comme mécanisble au même titre que nos facultés manuelles. L'intelligence artificielle ne doit-elle pas sa capacité d'imitation au fait qu'elle a été théorisée, inventée, développée d'après une certaine représentation, peut-être incomplète ou biaisée des ressorts de notre conscience, si bien que les miracles de l'IA nous inviteraient à explorer à nouveau frais l'irréductible singularité de notre propre pensée. L'intelligence artificielle, notre deuxième conscience, à l'occasion de la fête de la science, j'aurai le plaisir d'en débattre sans préjugés au côté du mathématicien et philosophe Daniel Angler, de la professeur en intelligence artificielle et chercheuse Laurence de Ville et du philosophe Valentin Husson. \n",

      " Bonjour Laurence de Villers. Bonjour. Vous êtes professeur en intelligence artificielle à Sorbonne Université, chercheuse au CNRS, auteur de Lia Ange ou démon paru en 2025 aux éditions du CER et présidente de la Fondation Blaise Pascal. Bonjour Daniel Andler. Bonjour. Vous êtes mathématicien, philosophe, professeur émérite à Sorbonne Université, membre de l'Académie des sciences morales et politiques et auteur de intelligence artificielle, intelligence humaine, la double énigme aux éditions Gallimard et bonjour Valentin Husson. Vous êtes philosophe et auteur de fou le ressentimentale petite philosophie des Trolls chez philosophie Magazine éditeur qui vient de paraître. Alors pour commencer cette cette discussion sur l'intelligence artificielle, je voulais vous vous soumettre une histoire qui a eu lieu récemment en mars 2025. Le Nouvel Obs a décidé d'organiser un concours littéraire entre deux auteurs entre guillemets. Alors le premier était Hervé Letellier pris en cours 2020 auteur de du du célèbre roman l'anomalie et le deuxième était l'intelligence artificielle et plus précisément de chat GPT. Le l'objet de ce concours était de demander à l'un comme à l'autre entre guillemets de rédiger une nouvelle et puis avec la première phrase qui était indiquée c'était quelqu'un qui découvrait un cadavre et la dernière phrase de la nouvelle aussi. Hervé Letellier a rendu sa copie. Chat GPT aussi et de la ve même de Hervé Letellier il a dit franchement je suis absolument bluffé par la créativité littéraire entre guillemets de chat GPT peut-être même que Chat GPT m'a battu, que la nouvelle qui a été rendue par l'intelligence artificielle était plus drôle, plus originale, plus vive que celle que j'ai écrite et peut-être donc que ça inaugure un monde où les écrivains seront moins moins présents que l'intelligence artificielle. Daniel Andler une telle histoire qu'est-ce qu'elle révèle ? Est-ce qu'elle signifie que Lia peut battre l'esprit humain dans ce qu'il a de plus propre, la créativité. \n",

      " Ah, je ne le pense pas. Euh, mais je pense que c'est pas original de pas le penser. On est généralement réticent à euh reconnaître que la créativité échapperait d'une certaine façon à l'être humain. Euh, il est très frappant que Hervé Le Tellier, avec qui j'ai d'ailleurs débattu tout à fait récemment dans un autre lieu, euh, se ce soit en quelque sorte presque d'avance déclaré battu. Mais c'est qu'il est persuadé, Hervé Le Tellier, qu'effectivement, l'intelligence humaine étant déroute en quelque sorte. Euh, ce qui est assez intéressant parce que voilà un écrivain, hein, dont c'est le métier en quelque sorte, qui est déjà en quelque sorte acquis l'idée que l'intelligence artificielle euh, est capable de battre l'homme sur le plan de la créativité. Il faut reconnaître, alors, il me semble que très rapidement, je veux pas du tout être trop long, mais très rapidement, il s'agit d'un de ce qu'on appelle un exercice de style, c'est-à-dire, euh, une une une épreuve assez semblable au fond à une dissertation, si vous voulez, avec des contraintes, et faire la meilleure dissertation possible dans un temps limité et qui euh, qui obéissent à ses contraintes, c'est au fond résoudre un problème de créativité. C'est plutôt de l'ordre de l'exercice. Euh, ça si vous voulez, c'est un peu comme résoudre un exercice de mathématiques un petit peu difficile, mais c'est résoudre un exercice de mathématiques, c'est pas faire de la recherche en maths, c'est pas faire quelque chose de vraiment nouveau. Donc, il me semble que Hervé Le Tellier et d'autres sont trop impressionnés par le résultat et euh, ne pensent pas suffisamment au processus lui-même. Et le processus de la création, me semble-t-il, est euh, une un un une motivation initiale d'un écrivain ou d'un artiste ou d'un compositeur, de faire du mieux qu'il peut pour s'adresser à un public. Donc, il y a au départ, le créateur, à l'arrivée, le public, alors que il y a rien de tout ça pour l'intelligence artificielle. L'intelligence artificielle n'est pas une personne qui cherche à faire quelque chose. C'est une machine extraordinairement bluffante, ça, je vous l'avoue. Une machine qui répond à une demande, à savoir, écrire un une nouvelle policière avec cette ce début et cette fin. C'est tout à fait autre chose. \n",

      " Oui, je pense qu'ils ont été euh usurpés par cette machine qui a vu d'ailleurs toutes leurs textes, qui connaît toutes leurs données, tous les livres préalables et les livres peut-être du monde entier pour créer cette petite nouvelle qui est effectivement un exercice de style, qui est moins facile pour un humain, puisqu'on donne la première phrase, on donne la dernière et il y a un nombre de caractères. Donc si vous voulez, c'est une optimisation dans un un océan de documents et ça, la machine sait très bien faire. Donc, c'est pas du tout étonnant que elle est qu'elle soit meilleure. Moi, j'aurais dit à l'avance, évidemment, qu'elles étaient meilleures. C'est la même chose, vous voulez que pour aller trouver dans des radios, des cancers précoces, la machine fait autre chose que nous et elle peut nous surprendre et apporter de l'information. Et même et c'est pas de la créativité là, c'est vraiment de la réutilisation de texte. Il faut bien comprendre cela, parce que ces machines qui nous bluffent en ce moment, elles sont nourries de toutes nos données. Or actuellement, elles en produisent aussi des données approximatives qui demain seront celles qui vont nourrir les prochaines machines. Et là, on va voir baisser gravement la créativité de ces machines. Ça, c'est l'effet qu'on ne voit pas encore aujourd'hui. On est bluffé par le premier step, la première, parce que c'est nos données à l'intérieur. Et j'ai et monsieur Letellier, comme d'autres et il a été ré compensé par un prix, sont des gens brillants qui ont créé des choses assez extraordinaires. Et et c'est ces données-là qui sont à l'intérieur. Et cette machine qui crée cette IA qui crée des données en ce moment, elle se nourrit de de milliers d'années, enfin, depuis qu'on a des traces, en fait, depuis qu'on on sauvegarde des traces et que ensuite, on les a numérisées, elle elle patoge dans tout ça. Et là, il y a des lumières, il y a des choses intéressantes, il y a des rapprochements. Alors, ce qu'elle ne sait pas faire, c'est faire des métaphores. Elle fait des analogies, cette machine. Elle a tout ce jeu de données, elle a des contraintes et elle va jouer par analogie, elle va tricoter comme ça. Voilà, bon, c'est pas de l'art, c'est pas de la créativité, c'est de l'optimisation mathématique dans un énorme possible. Mais cet énorme possible, il joue pour beaucoup sur ce qu'on obtient à la fin. Puisque sinon, c'est juste une moulinete algorithmique. Et le jour où les données seront de moins bonne qualité parce que les gens voudront plus créer où ce sera les machines qui créeront et donc elles vont boucler au bout d'un moment et sans doute descendre en créativité. C'est nous qui apportons cette touche de nouveau, de vision métaphorique, d'inconscient, on en parlera après, qui va venir troubler tout ça, c'est l'humain. \n",

Si Harvé Letellier, si l'humain en règle générale se croit d'emblée vaincu et par avance vaincu par l'intelligence artificielle, il y a un biais psychologique. C'est que il y a une angoisse fondamentale de l'être humain à l'égard de la machine et cela depuis des siècles. Ça Freud disait, il y a trois blessures narcissiques de l'homme. La première, c'est Copernic, nous ne sommes plus au centre de l'univers, la seconde c'est Darwin, nous ne sommes plus premiers dans l'ordre de la création. La troisième c'est la psychanalyse, le moindre est plus maître dans sa propre maison j'en ajouterai une quatrième, c'est-à-dire que, avec l'intelligence artificielle, nous avons l'impression que notre conscience n'est plus maîtresse d'elle-même. Nous ne sommes plus les les les les maîtres de notre intelligence et je crois que c'est une angoisse c'est une angoisse fondamentale de perte de de perte de maîtrise. Alors vous disiez tout à l'heure que, en effet, quand on est par exemple étudiant, on apprend des mécanismes. Mais justement ce qui fait l'humain et je dirais le l'honneur et la beauté de l'humanité, c'est que justement nous arrivons à nous désautomatiser, à nous désautomatiser, pardon, comme disait Bernard Stigler. Nous avons des automatismes, mais il y a quelque chose de formidable chez l'homme, c'est que un moment donné il peut faire rupture. Il peut bifurquer. Ça s'appelle la créativité, ça s'appelle l'inventivité. Quand appeler ça le génist, qui est inimitable. Et en ce ce sens-là, je ne désespère pas de l'être humain, quand à la pensée, quand à l'humour peut-être qu'on n'en parlera, mais il y a des choses proprement humaines que l'intelligence artificielle ne pourra jamais reproduire.

      "        Comment expliquer les progrès phénoménaux que semble avoir accomplis l'intelligence artificielle au cours de ces dernières années. Depuis l'apparition de chat GPT en novembre 2022, rapidement suivi par d'autres agents conversationnels. Cette révolution technologique aux multiples aspects paraît désormais capable d'exécuter de nombreuses tâches intellectuelles sur lesquelles l'esprit humain pensait jusqu'à alors exercer un monopole. Écrire des articles, synthétiser des documents, traiter des données dans n'importe quel domaine, diagnostiquer une maladie, rédiger une dissertation, ou pourquoi pas, un scénario de film. Non contente de révolutionner le monde du travail, ses prouesses stupéfiantes de la technique soulèvent une interrogation majeure dans le domaine de la philosophie de l'esprit. Faut-il en déduire que l'intelligence, n'étant pas le propre d'un cerveau biologique et encore moins d'une âme, peut s'implémenter dans n'importe quelle machine, voir, comme s'inquiètent ou exultent certains, que l'IA sera un jour en mesure de remplacer notre conscience. À moins qu'il ne faille poser cette question à l'envers. Comment se fait-il que la machine puisse imiter les œuvres de de notre esprit. Comment est-il possible en d'autres termes que notre vie mentale se révèle comme mécanisble au même titre que nos facultés manuelles. L'intelligence artificielle ne doit-elle pas sa capacité d'imitation au fait qu'elle a été théorisée, inventée, développée d'après une certaine représentation, peut-être incomplète ou biaisée des ressorts de notre conscience, si bien que les miracles de l'IA nous inviteraient à explorer à nouveau frais l'irréductible singularité de notre propre pensée. L'intelligence artificielle, notre deuxième conscience, à l'occasion de la fête de la science, j'aurai le plaisir d'en débattre sans préjugés au côté du mathématicien et philosophe Daniel Angler, de la professeur en intelligence artificielle et chercheuse Laurence de Ville et du philosophe Valentin Husson.\n",

      "        Bonjour Laurence de Villers. Bonjour. Vous êtes professeur en intelligence artificielle à Sorbonne Université, chercheuse au CNRS, auteur de Lia Ange ou démon paru en 2025 aux éditions du CER et présidente de la Fondation Blaise Pascal. Bonjour Daniel Andler. Bonjour. Vous êtes mathématicien, philosophe, professeur émérite à Sorbonne Université, membre de l'Académie des sciences morales et politiques et auteur de intelligence artificielle, intelligence humaine, la double énigme aux éditions Gallimard et bonjour Valentin Husson. Vous êtes philosophe et auteur de fou le ressentimentale petite philosophie des Trolls chez philosophie Magazine éditeur qui vient de paraître. Alors pour commencer cette cette discussion sur l'intelligence artificielle, je voulais vous vous soumettre une histoire qui a eu lieu récemment en mars 2025. Le Nouvel Obs a décidé d'organiser un concours littéraire entre deux auteurs entre guillemets. Alors le premier était Hervé Letellier pris en cours 2020 auteur de du du célèbre roman l'anomalie et le deuxième était l'intelligence artificielle et plus précisément de chat GPT. Le l'objet de ce concours était de demander à l'un comme à l'autre entre guillemets de rédiger une nouvelle et puis avec la première phrase qui était indiquée c'était quelqu'un qui découvrait un cadavre et la dernière phrase de la nouvelle aussi. Hervé Letellier a rendu sa copie. Chat GPT aussi et de la ve même de Hervé Letellier il a dit franchement je suis absolument bluffé par la créativité littéraire entre guillemets de chat GPT peut-être même que Chat GPT m'a battu, que la nouvelle qui a été rendue par l'intelligence artificielle était plus drôle, plus originale, plus vive que celle que j'ai écrite et peut-être donc que ça inaugure un monde où les écrivains seront moins moins présents que l'intelligence artificielle. Daniel Andler une telle histoire qu'est-ce qu'elle révèle ? Est-ce qu'elle signifie que Lia peut battre l'esprit humain dans ce qu'il a de plus propre, la créativité.\n",

      "        Ah, je ne le pense pas. Euh, mais je pense que c'est pas original de pas le penser. On est généralement réticent à euh reconnaître que la créativité échapperait d'une certaine façon à l'être humain. Euh, il est très frappant que Hervé Le Tellier, avec qui j'ai d'ailleurs débattu tout à fait récemment dans un autre lieu, euh, se ce soit en quelque sorte presque d'avance déclaré battu. Mais c'est qu'il est persuadé, Hervé Le Tellier, qu'effectivement, l'intelligence humaine étant déroute en quelque sorte. Euh, ce qui est assez intéressant parce que voilà un écrivain, hein, dont c'est le métier en quelque sorte, qui est déjà en quelque sorte acquis l'idée que l'intelligence artificielle euh, est capable de battre l'homme sur le plan de la créativité. Il faut reconnaître, alors, il me semble que très rapidement, je veux pas du tout être trop long, mais très rapidement, il s'agit d'un de ce qu'on appelle un exercice de style, c'est-à-dire, euh, une une une épreuve assez semblable au fond à une dissertation, si vous voulez, avec des contraintes, et faire la meilleure dissertation possible dans un temps limité et qui euh, qui obéissent à ses contraintes, c'est au fond résoudre un problème de créativité. C'est plutôt de l'ordre de l'exercice. Euh, ça si vous voulez, c'est un peu comme résoudre un exercice de mathématiques un petit peu difficile, mais c'est résoudre un exercice de mathématiques, c'est pas faire de la recherche en maths, c'est pas faire quelque chose de vraiment nouveau. Donc, il me semble que Hervé Le Tellier et d'autres sont trop impressionnés par le résultat et euh, ne pensent pas suffisamment au processus lui-même. Et le processus de la création, me semble-t-il, est euh, une un un une motivation initiale d'un écrivain ou d'un artiste ou d'un compositeur, de faire du mieux qu'il peut pour s'adresser à un public. Donc, il y a au départ, le créateur, à l'arrivée, le public, alors que il y a rien de tout ça pour l'intelligence artificielle. L'intelligence artificielle n'est pas une personne qui cherche à faire quelque chose. C'est une machine extraordinairement bluffante, ça, je vous l'avoue. Une machine qui répond à une demande, à savoir, écrire un une nouvelle policière avec cette ce début et cette fin. C'est tout à fait autre chose.\n",

      "        Est-ce que vous pensez aussi Laurence Deviller que Hervé Le Tellier et ceux qui ont été impressionnés par ce par ce concours ont cédé en un sens à ce mirage ou à cette illusion du du résultat ?\n",

      "        Laurence Devillers: \n",
      "        Oui, je pense qu'ils ont été euh usurpés par cette machine qui a vu d'ailleurs toutes leurs textes, qui connaît toutes leurs données, tous les livres préalables et les livres peut-être du monde entier pour créer cette petite nouvelle qui est effectivement un exercice de style, qui est moins facile pour un humain, puisqu'on donne la première phrase, on donne la dernière et il y a un nombre de caractères. Donc si vous voulez, c'est une optimisation dans un un océan de documents et ça, la machine sait très bien faire. Donc, c'est pas du tout étonnant que elle est qu'elle soit meilleure. Moi, j'aurais dit à l'avance, évidemment, qu'elles étaient meilleures. C'est la même chose, vous voulez que pour aller trouver dans des radios, des cancers précoces, la machine fait autre chose que nous et elle peut nous surprendre et apporter de l'information. Et même et c'est pas de la créativité là, c'est vraiment de la réutilisation de texte. Il faut bien comprendre cela, parce que ces machines qui nous bluffent en ce moment, elles sont nourries de toutes nos données. Or actuellement, elles en produisent aussi des données approximatives qui demain seront celles qui vont nourrir les prochaines machines. Et là, on va voir baisser gravement la créativité de ces machines. Ça, c'est l'effet qu'on ne voit pas encore aujourd'hui. On est bluffé par le premier step, la première, parce que c'est nos données à l'intérieur. Et j'ai et monsieur Letellier, comme d'autres et il a été ré compensé par un prix, sont des gens brillants qui ont créé des choses assez extraordinaires. Et et c'est ces données-là qui sont à l'intérieur. Et cette machine qui crée cette IA qui crée des données en ce moment, elle se nourrit de de milliers d'années, enfin, depuis qu'on a des traces, en fait, depuis qu'on on sauvegarde des traces et que ensuite, on les a numérisées, elle elle patoge dans tout ça. Et là, il y a des lumières, il y a des choses intéressantes, il y a des rapprochements. Alors, ce qu'elle ne sait pas faire, c'est faire des métaphores. Elle fait des analogies, cette machine. Elle a tout ce jeu de données, elle a des contraintes et elle va jouer par analogie, elle va tricoter comme ça. Voilà, bon, c'est pas de l'art, c'est pas de la créativité, c'est de l'optimisation mathématique dans un énorme possible. Mais cet énorme possible, il joue pour beaucoup sur ce qu'on obtient à la fin. Puisque sinon, c'est juste une moulinete algorithmique. Et le jour où les données seront de moins bonne qualité parce que les gens voudront plus créer où ce sera les machines qui créeront et donc elles vont boucler au bout d'un moment et sans doute descendre en créativité. C'est nous qui apportons cette touche de nouveau, de vision métaphorique, d'inconscient, on en parlera après, qui va venir troubler tout ça, c'est l'humain.\n",

      "        Valentin Husson: \n",
      "        Oui, il y a peut-être quelque chose de de mécanique mais je voudrais revenir sur cette sur cette chose-là. Si Harvé Letellier, si l'humain en règle générale se croit d'emblée vaincu et par avance vaincu par l'intelligence artificielle, il y a un biais psychologique. C'est que il y a une angoisse fondamentale de l'être humain à l'égard de la machine et cela depuis des siècles. Ça Freud disait, il y a trois blessures narcissiques de l'homme. La première, c'est Copernic, nous ne sommes plus au centre de l'univers, la seconde c'est Darwin, nous ne sommes plus premiers dans l'ordre de la création. La troisième c'est la psychanalyse, le moindre est plus maître dans sa propre maison j'en ajouterai une quatrième, c'est-à-dire que, avec l'intelligence artificielle, nous avons l'impression que notre conscience n'est plus maîtresse d'elle-même. Nous ne sommes plus les les les les maîtres de notre intelligence et je crois que c'est une angoisse c'est une angoisse fondamentale de perte de de perte de maîtrise. Alors vous disiez tout à l'heure que, en effet, quand on est par exemple étudiant, on apprend des mécanismes. Mais justement ce qui fait l'humain et je dirais le l'honneur et la beauté de l'humanité, c'est que justement nous arrivons à nous désautomatiser, à nous désautomatiser, pardon, comme disait Bernard Stigler. Nous avons des automatismes, mais il y a quelque chose de formidable chez l'homme, c'est que un moment donné il peut faire rupture. Il peut bifurquer. Ça s'appelle la créativité, ça s'appelle l'inventivité. Quand appeler ça le génist, qui est inimitable. Et en ce ce sens-là, je ne désespère pas de l'être humain, quand à la pensée, quand à l'humour peut-être qu'on n'en parlera, mais il y a des choses proprement humaines que l'intelligence artificielle ne pourra jamais reproduire.

      "        Laurence de Vilard, juste pour pour euh euh euh continuer cette discussion, mais en en en en faisant aussi référence à une autre forme d'inquiétude qui a pu être apportée par par l'intelligence artificielle. On a assisté en 2023, pendant euh 6 mois, enfin entre mai et septembre, euh à un mouvement euh vraiment inédit euh dans l'histoire sociale américaine, une grève euh de scénaristes euh à Hollywood euh qui ne s'était pas produite dans de cette ampleur, avec cette ampleur depuis, je crois, 40 ans. Euh dont la revendication première était leur inquiétude d'être remplacé euh par l'intelligence artificielle, par les producteurs dans l'écriture de de de de scénario. Qu'est-ce que ça révèle aussi des inquiétudes professionnelles très concrètes euh que cette révolution technologique peut susciter ? Alors,\n",

      "        Laurence Devillers: \n",
      "        Alors, elle s'essuie, effectivement, toutes ces inquiétudes avec sûrement des métiers qui vont disparaître. On a tort de penser que on est super intelligent en tout et qu'on va rester là. Dès lors que on fait des copier-coller de ce que font ces machines dans beaucoup de travaux. Regardez, nos étudiants fondent ça dans leur dissertation, et ben c'est une perte de pouvoir. Les ingénieurs qui codent avec des codes faits par des machines, c'est une perte de pouvoir. D'abord parce qu'ils comprennent pas tout ce qu'ils font et puis que ils sont désapprennent. Donc attention à ce côté-là, là on pourrait être remplacé. Dès lors que vous utilisez trop ces machines et que vous formatez sur cette standardisation, vous risquez d'être remplacé. Alors, qu'est-ce que dans cette machine fait que il y a une sorte de créativité artificielle ? C'est qu'en fait, on a volontairement rajouté du hasard. Il y a par exemple la température, lorsque vous parlez de ChatGPT, il a un facteur qui fait qu'il peut aller chercher au hasard des choses. Il, on dit il maximise les probabilités, il va vers des statistiques, mais il a des mécanismes pour aller au-delà et ça c'est quelque chose qu'on c'est un curseur, on décide d'en mettre ou pas en mettre. Et nous, dans les mains, avec ChatGPT le premier et ses outils qui ont été utilisés pour faire cette cette cette ce test avec avec le telier, c'est ce sont des outils qui ont cette particularité d'avoir un peu d'aléatoire, qui va sortir un aléatoire proche de ce qu'on a dit et qui apporte une sorte de lumière différente un peu métaphorique par hasard, mais il faut le rappeler, ce n'est pas de l'intelligence. Ce n'est pas de la conscience, il y a aucune intention de la machine de faire quoi que ce soit, c'est piloté par un algorithme. La volonté des humains aussi, finalement, de flouter, l'intelligence en faisant croire que la machine peut avoir cette sorte de possible qui lui donnerait finalement une espèce de de pour les capacités humaines, en tout cas, une certaine conscience, une espèce de compréhension. La machine ne comprend pas, n'a pas de conscience, n'a pas d'intention, n'a pas d'émotion. Il faut vraiment rabâcher cela, il faut vraiment qu'on comprenne à quel point c'est vide de sens et c'est algorithmique.\n",

Alors, Daniel Andler, dans votre dans votre ouvrage, intelligence euh humaine, intelligence artificielle, la double énigme, vous revenez euh euh sur ce que vous appelez le rêve euh prométhéen euh qui a inspiré euh la la création euh de l'intelligence artificielle. Comment définiriez-vous ce rêve et euh 70 ans après son apparition, euh où où en sommes-nous de ce rêve ?\n",

      "        Daniel Andler: \n",
      "        Alors, voilà, voilà une question sur laquelle Laurence aura beaucoup de choses à dire, je le sais d'avance. Euh Alors, le rêve est assez simple, c'est véritablement de doter donc de de voler au Dieu ou à la création le secret de l''intelligence humaine, comprise à l'époque de manière pas très analytique, l'intelligence était aussi bien la conscience et le mental en général. C'est toute cette production de notre esprit qui a donné les inventions, la culture, la civilisation, la la capacité d'intervenir de manière pratique euh dans toutes sortes, dans toutes nos activités. Et donc l'idée c'était de d'obtenir qu'une machine, un ordinateur, qui venait de sortir des laboratoires militaires une machine soit capable d'en faire autant. Donc on vole en quelque sorte au Dieu le secret de le secret de l'intelligence, de la conscience humaine. Donc ça c'est le premier aspect prométhéen et puis c'est prométhéen parce que ce qu'on va obtenir, c'est quelque chose d'absolument extraordinaire. C'est une machine intelligente, une machine intelligente au sens humain. Donc sans sans guillemets, pas intelligente entre entre guillemets. Intelligente comme on aurait tendance à dire, oui, certes les machines sont intelligentes, mais elles sont pas intelligentes comme nous. Alors euh ça ça ça ça très rapidement bifurqué dans deux directions. Une direction euh très euh philosophique, conceptuelle, science fiction et cetera. On se demande mais qu'est-ce que c'est? qu'est-ce que ça voudrait dire comment on s'en apercevrait, comment on peut le tester et cetera. Donc le test de Turing et toutes ces questions là, tout ce qu'on fait évidemment en philosophie de l'esprit et du langage. Donc une quête assez conceptuelle, intéressante, sans véritable conclusion puisque des gens disaient c'est complètement impossible pour telle ou telle raison, par exemple parce qu'une machine par définition ça pense pas, oui mais alors on peut pas commencer à discuter comme ça, qu'est-ce que tu en sais. Et qu'est-ce que tu sais de, et ça je reprends un petit peu pour la taquiner Laurence. euh Elle dit on sait et c'est il faut il faut répéter que une machine ne comprend pas. Euh oui mais pardon mais c'est quoi exactement comprendre. Pour l'être humain c'est quoi comprendre? On ne le sait pas très bien. C'est quoi être conscient, on ne le sait pas très bien. Donc c'est difficile bah oui, je sais que tu vas tu vas répondre. Donc mais je je veux je veux comment dire répondre de manière un tout petit peu plus complète en deux trois minutes euh donc à à à votre question. Donc, premièrement, un rêve qui reste discuté, est-ce que c'est possible pas possible, contradictoire, catastrophique et cetera. Deuxièmement, euh une entreprise qui est beaucoup plus proche des métiers de l'ingénieur qui consiste tout simplement à fabriquer des machines, des algorithmes, en fait, qui vont être capable de faire des choses précises, de jouer aux échecs, de jouer aux dames, de planifier, je ne sais pas la tournée des bennes à ordures à Paris compte tenu de telle et telle contrainte et cetera et cetera. Et ça, c'est un programme de d'intelligence artificielle qui euh a qui marche et qui euh effectivement euh fait des progrès constants. Et euh la question est de savoir euh est-ce que en en additionnant en quelque sorte toutes ces solutions de mécanisation, de d'automatisation de différentes tâches, est-ce que ça va finir par constituer une intelligence humaine? Alors la l'histoire de de l'IA en en très très gros et scandé par deux grandes périodes. Une période où on s'est dit on va essayer d'analyser la manière dont nos pensées conscientes s'organisent et s'enchaînent de manière à nous faire gagner aux échecs ou gagner au poker et cetera, ou organiser la tournée des ordures correctement, et on va essayer de voir ce que l'esprit humain fait par introspection par des méthodes de psychologie expérimentale. Une fois qu'on aura une idée suffisamment claire de ça, on va l'écrire sous forme d'algorithme. On va faire tourner l'algorithme et si ça marche eh bien on aura conféré à à l'ordinateur la capacité de faire ces choses-là. Alors ça n'a pas très bien marché. On exagère aussi le fait que ça c'est c'est un échec, c'est pas un échec complet mais ça quand même fait à traverser à l'intelligence artificielle ce qu'on appelle les les hivers, c'est-à-dire les moments où vraiment il y avait plus beaucoup d'argent pour travailler et la renaissance est venue de ce deuxième paradigme qu'on appelle parfois le connexionnisme ou l'approche réseau qui est ce qui a conduit aujourd'hui au triomphe actuel de l'intelligence artificielle. Et la grande différence entre le premier et le second c'est que le second ne veut pas du tout s'intéresser à ce qui se passe dans la pensée consciente. Il pense plutôt à des à à à un processus dont le l'image type c'est la perception. Quand vous percevez quelque chose, vous ne raisonnez pas. Vous ne savez pas comment vous faites pour reconnaître Laurence que j'avais pas vu depuis quelques mois. J'ai tout de suite reconnu Laurence mais j'aurais été incapable de dire pourquoi et comment comment mon système visuel etc., ma mémoire visuelle a m'a permis de d'identifier euh Laurence. Donc, on n'a plus prise sur la pensée consciente, on n'a pas non plus prise directement sur les processus neuronaux. On s'en inspire mais on n'a pas directement. Et comment est-ce qu'on va faire que la machine au lieu de lui donner des instructions explicites sur comment il doit faire pour organiser ceci et cela, on va lui présenter des exemples d'une bonne performance. Par exemple, on va présenter une image de Laurence et la machine va dire c'est quelqu'un d'autre. Euh et et on va la corriger et peu à peu quand on lui présentera une image de Laurence elle verra on elle elle dira Laurence. Et ce qui est l'intuition fondamentale, c'est que ce que je viens de dire à propos de reconnaissance d'image visuelle ou sonore qui est assez facile à comprendre s'applique à toutes les performances cognitive. Et c'est ça le un peu le coup de génie si vous voulez du du connexionnisme.\n",

      "        Vous vous parliez tout à l'heure, Valentin Husson de de blessures euh narcissiques pour raconter l'histoire de de de l'intelligence, enfin en tout cas pour tirer le bilan, faire le bilan en un sens de de l'intelligence artificielle. J' j'aimerais vous vous lire un un un un passage un petit ex extrait de d'un ouvrage qui date de 1948 euh de Cybernetics de Norbert Weiner, l'un des inventeurs, des précurseurs de de l'intelligence artificielle. La première révolution industrielle, dit dit-il, fut la dévaluation du bras humain par la concurrence de la machine. Le gagne-pain minimum d'un prolétaire américain ne sera jamais assez bas pour faire face au travail d'une d'une excavatrice à vapeur. La révolution industrielle moderne est pareillement à même de dévaluer le cerveau humain, au moins dans ses décisions les plus simples et les plus routinières. Est-ce qu'on a à faire véritablement à une dévaluation ou à une découverte progressive du propre de ce cerveau humain qui est pour le dire en anglais, le feeling, la capacité d'avoir un moment non seulement des données en nous-mêmes, mais de sentir l'effet que nous fait par exemple le fait de de dialoguer ensemble, de se voir mutuellement, de s'écouter.\n",

      "        Alors, avant de vous répondre, je vais vous répondre, je voudrais replacer la révolution de l'intelligence artificielle dans un contexte un peu plus large. Finalement au niveau des révolutions techniques de la communication, il y a eu l'invention de l'écriture. Il y a eu l'invention de l'imprimerie et aujourd'hui est il y a la révolution numérique et l'invention de l'intelligence artificielle. Euh l'invention de l'écriture, on s'en rend pas compte, mais c'est l'invention du monothéisme à partir du moment où on a un calame et un papyrus, on peut diffuser ses croyances au-delà de sa tribu, on peut convertir et universaliser. L'invention de l'imprimerie, il y aurait pas eu la les lumières et les révolutions des Lumières s'il n'y avait pas eu la capacité de diffuser et de démocratiser les savoirs. Aujourd'hui, on est à l'époque de la révolution numérique et de l'invention de l'intelligence artificielle. Et comme je le disais tout à l'heure, il y a une angoisse fondamentale qui naît de là parce qu'on a l'impression que enfin euh comment dirais-je, ceux dont on avait peur, cet épouvantail qui était celui du deus ex machina du Dieu sorti de la machine est enfin arrivé pour le pire ou pour le meilleur. C'est une promesse et c'est un danger. On a l'impression que désormais euh nous avons véritablement une divinité qui a récolté d'une manière encyclopédique tout le savoir du monde qui est omnisciente et qui en même temps omnipotente, c'est-à-dire qu'il pourrait tout faire à notre place. Alors en effet, aujourd'hui, on peut prendre ça comme une dévaluation de euh de de de l'intelligence humaine. Comme il y a eu une dévaluation, comme vous le disiez de euh la main et du travail humain à partir de la révolution industrielle. Mais je voudrais pas être catastrophiste et comme je le disais tout à l'heure, euh comment dirais-je ? Le le on ne remplacera pas certaines choses de l'homme. Je pense à un texte de Bergson qui dit \"On peut fonctionner le langage le langage humain, le langage courant fonctionne à partir d'étiquettes, on met des étiquettes sur les choses, on parle de manière plutôt stéréotypée, on a appris une grammaire qui est stéréotypée.\" Euh mais j'aimerais tout de même faire valoir comme tout à l'heure la dimension poétique du langage dont je pense que l'intelligence artificielle ne peut pas encore euh faire ou produire. Euh cette cette dimension poétique du langage, c'est précisément le fait que nous avons un nuancier d'émotions. Nous avons un un un nuancier de sentiments en nous, nous avons une coloration de toutes ces choses-là qui fait que euh l'intelligence, comme elle est dépourvue d'émotivité, comme elle est dépourvue de sentiment, comme elle est dépourvue de corps, comme elle ne peut pas faire l'expérience de l'événement de ce qui est imprévu, manque totalement à cette valeur proprement humaine du langage qui est celui de la poésie. Donc dévaluation peut-être en un sens, mais euh il y a une valeur de l'intelligence humaine et de du langage dont je pense que l'IA ne n'atteint pas encore.\n",

      "        dans votre ouvrage l'IA Ange ou Démon. Vous réfléchissez beaucoup à un aspect qui me semble très intéressant qui est l'effet presque de télescopage entre des évolutions techniques et des discours sur ces évolutions techniques souvent d'ailleurs par les inventeurs de ces évolutions techniques. Et et et vous montrez que ça peut créer une forme d'illusion d'optique voire le moque serait trop fort mais en tout cas parfois de mensonges marketing. Est-ce que vous pensez que la question de la la conscience de l'intelligence artificielle est au cœur de cette illusion?\n",

      "        Oui oui, c'est tout à fait ce qui se passe puisqu'en fait le terme de l'intelligence artificielle ou de super intelligence, Il est largement galvauudé aujourd'hui, hein. on parle d'intelligence des machines comme celle des humains, qui n'a rien à voir. On est tout à fait d'accord, il y a pas de corps, il y a pas d'émotion. Et pourtant, le discours de Sam Altman, Eric Schmidt, Elon Musk, Marc Zuckerberg vont euh à l'unisson dire que nous sommes proches de cette super intelligence. Alors c'est un récit technologique, c'est du storytelling qui nous fascine, parce qu'il y a un espèce de désir aussi de l'humain d'avoir cette machine qui nous ressemble, qui va être là tout le temps qu'on veut, pour euh combler cette solitude de l'humain. C'est assez incroyable. Pour moi il y a il y a effectivement un leur de la part des humains qui anthropomorphise cette machine, qui pense que effectivement elle comprend, qu'elle a des affects, et qu'elle a même des intentions d'ordre moral. Bah, c'est tout à fait faux, ils les prennent pour des psys Enfin, je je comprends pourquoi on fait ça. jusqu'à présent, je sais pas, on écrivait un un journal euh privé et donc on se parlait à soi-même. Et cette machine, c'est un peu ça. On se parle à soi-même. En plus ça s'aligne à nous, donc elle nous conforte dans ce que nous sommes. Donc c'est tout sauf un psy. Bon, après, c'est peut-être un meilleur ami pour beaucoup, parce qu'ils se sentent vraiment tout seul. Mais ça veut dire quoi de notre société si on a besoin de s'isoler avec ces machines ? Alors, ça, c'est c'est c'est absolument terrible que cette euh IA qui, pour moi, fait faire des choses extraordinaires pour nous, hein, vraiment au niveau scientifique, de découverte euh et que l'on l'utilise qu'on gâche de l'énergie, finalement, pour aller discuter avec cette machine et pour dire des choses qui sont pas du tout importantes. Le langage, vous avez beaucoup expliqué ça. Donc, c'est cette arnaque, alors, je continue quand même sur les géants du numériques. Euh, l'arnaque, elle est d'ordre politique, d'ordre pouvoir et économique, hein, puisqu'on voit qu'il y a cette course effrénée à être le premier qui va atteindre cette espèce de Graal qui est la super intelligence qu'ils attendront jamais puis ont ils vont décider tout seul sans mesures scientifiques qu'ils sont arrivés. Ça cache quoi ? Et ben, en fait, ils sont en train de nous dire, euh ils vous ont prévenu, hein, on ne pourra pas contrôler ce système. Et donc, ça serait peut-être intéressant, et je l'ai entendu de la part de Sam Altman et d'autres, de lui donner une personnalité juridique. Vous voyez, on va aller très très loin si on ne fait ça, et ça serait une grave erreur d'écouter cela. Donc, c'est un problème de responsabilité, c'est autre chose. Il y a du marketing, de la politique, du pouvoir, et de la responsabilité qui est galvauudé à travers ce discours. Et nous, on le on le ressent, surtout quand on n'est pas expert, on se disant mais ça y est, ces machines arrivent, donc on va m'embaucher de mon travail, beaucoup d'angoisse. Et c'est c'est une volonté aussi de déstabiliser, finalement, nos démocraties. Donc, on a en ce moment euh et c'est dans les mains beaucoup des Américains avec un un pouvoir extrêmement dangereux, euh qui va dans un sens de transhumanisme, de totalitarisme, et je pense qu'il il y a en grandeur un risque réel euh politique, hein. Moi, je suis beaucoup plus anxieuse que vous, quand vous en parlez. Si je reviens sur le langage. Le langage, c'est une construction C'est une construction parce que il y a des lexiques connus, parce que il y a une grammaire, et effectivement la machine est capable de reproduire ça comme elle était capable de jouer auf de voilà. C'est c'est, en fait, de la combinatoire. Et c'est exactement ce qu'elle fait lorsqu'elle crée son système, puisqu'elle découpe en tout petit bout les mots pour pouvoir en créer des nouveaux en les associant, c'est comme du puzzle, et cette combinatoire, elle est finalement possible, atteignable pour une machine, ce qui ne veut pas dire qu'elle comprend le langage humain, puis comme vous l'avez très bien dit, elle ne comprend pas la poésie, elle ne comprend pas le psyché des gens, elle a aucune incompréhension du contexte. Les prochains systèmes seront bien plus intelligents. On est en train d'en construire d'autres avec, justement, des corps. Les lunettes méta nous permettent d'enregistrer en contexte, on va aller sur du multimodal, les machines vont apprendre à planifier comme on le fait, ça sera beaucoup plus intelligent. Il est temps de se rendre compte que là c'est du bluff, c'est un leurre.\n",

Valentin Husson, dans votre ouvrage Fou Ressentimental, petite philosophie des trolls, vous proposez une thèse qui m'a euh interpellé, que je trouvais euh originale et et et qui, à mon avis, éclaire le le le sujet d'une d'une lumière différente. Au lieu de poser la question de la conscience, vous posez la question, alors au sujet de l'IA, mais de la révolution numérique dans son ensemble, de l'inconscient. Vous rappelez le fait que en psychanalyse, en tout cas chez Lacan, euh euh quatre concepts sont structurants pour penser la psychanalyse, l'inconscient, la répétition, le transfert, la pulsion, évidemment aussi le le refoulement, et vous proposez l'idée selon laquelle le sujet post-moderne, celui qui vit dans la révolution numérique, a en un sens un nouvel inconscient, un deuxième inconscient qui n'est pas l'inconscient psychanalytique, qui n'est pas l'inconscient des idéologies qui peuvent faire du lavage de cerveau, mais qui est l'inconscient numérique, c'est-à-dire la manière euh euh dont euh les données euh sont analysées, stockées, et puis traitées par l'intelligence euh artificielle.

      "        Euh Jacques Lacan disait l'inconscient est structuré comme un langage. Et en effet, dans mon livre fou le ressenti mental, je dis que l'inconscient désormais est structuré comme un langage numérique. Euh l'inconscient désormais est pris dans une binarité qui en définitive exclut toute forme de de nuance et qui crée la discorde et le conflit sur les sur les réseaux. Euh et vous avez rappelé les autres concepts fondamentaux de la psychanalyse. Si on prend par exemple, la question de la répétition. Euh l'intelligence artificielle qu'il faudrait nommer intelligence aussi algorithmique en vertu de la récolte de nos données va nous proposer sans cesse les mêmes euh contenus. Par conséquent, ne serait-ce par exemple que sur les sites de rencontre. On ne rencontre jamais l'autre, on rencontre toujours le même et par conséquent, il y a sans cesse une répétition des mêmes schémas d'existence. Euh le transfert en psychanalyse c'est extrêmement important, on suppose à son psychanalyste, par exemple, de tout savoir. Et l'intelligence artificielle désormais est devenue cet autre, ce Dieu, ce psychanalyste auquel on se fie et qu'on suppose tout savoir parce qu'il récolte toutes les toutes les euh données. Euh vous avez enfin, vous l'avez rappelé la question de la pulsion. Et alors ça c'est le caractère le plus problématique, le transfert est déjà problématique puisque euh euh une une étude montrait que 85 % des jeunes trouvaient que l'intelligence artificielle euh pouvait euh être un un un interlocuteur intime à leurs problèmes parce qu'il n'y avait pas de jugement euh moral. Euh mais sur la question de la pulsion, c'est beaucoup plus alarmant. Alors, j'étais tout à l'heure peu catastrofiste, mais fidèlement, comme Laurent, je le serai un peu plus désormais. Euh il y a une économie désormais, qu'on parle de la de de de de l'afec, de la captation, c'est une économie pulsionnelle où l'intelligence algorithmique se met euh au service du marketing des entreprises, du capitalisme, disons-le, pour euh capter euh nos pulsions les plus archaïques.

Le principe de réalité, c'est on attend, on n'a pas besoin, on peut euh différer notre satisfaction.

Mais à l'inconscient, c'est-à-dire à ce que nous avons de plus archaïque en nous, alors là l'intelligence artificielle peut-être va nous faire perdre toute forme de maîtrise et peut-être Alors que c'est nous qui l'avons inventé, va réinventer l'être humain et en faire tout à fait autre chose.

Euh et et je pense que euh quand nous referons euh tous les quatre cette émission dans 10 ans, on ne parlera plus tellement de comparer l'intelligence humaine à l'intelligence artificielle, de penser que l'intelligence artificielle va prendre le dessus, et cetera. On va en quelque sorte, je comprends je comprends très bien euh l'origine de ces angoisses, mais franchement c'est un sujet qui actuellement, en raison des malentendus, en raison, effectivement, du hype et du et cetera, des exagérations euh euh nous nous trouble beaucoup et c'est tout à fait normal qu'on s'en occupe. Mais euh je pense que l'intelligence artificielle va devenir au fond, et je suis pas le seul à le dire, une technologie normale, en quelque sorte, qu'on va peu à peu domestiquer. Alors ce que vient de dire Valentin est tout à fait important. Je crois pas que ça va modifier, enfin, l'inconscient numérique, il faudrait que j'y j'y réfléchisse, j'ai pas eu le temps de d'y réfléchir, mais euh ce que je ce qui me paraît absolument évident, c'est qu'il y a certains usages de l'IA couplés avec les réseaux sociaux, euh les les les les les compagnons IA, moi je pense qu'on personnellement, si j'avais le doigt sur le bouton, je dirais on interdit les compagnons IA, purement et simplement. Alors euh 80 % des adolescents, et une bonne partie des adultes, surtout aux États-Unis, vont dire \"Ouh là là, vous n'avez pas le droit, mais ce sont mes droits, si moi ça m'amuse,\" et cetera. Mais je pense qu'on va tout simplement euh limiter, en tout cas, très sérieusement. Et donc cette question va un petit peu disparaître. Et juste sur la question du remplacement, parce qu'on a plus beaucoup de temps. Le remplacement, c'est un mythe. Je veux dire, par je prends l'exemple typique. Ça fait 10 ans qu'on dit que l'intelligence artificielle va rendre les radiologues totalement inutiles, disparition. Et euh le fait est que 10 ans plus tard, il n'y a jamais eu autant de postes de radiologues. Donc euh il y a effectivement, ces outils sont extraordinairement intéressants pour le radiologue, il lui permet de faire mieux son métier de médecin. Et ça, il y a beaucoup beaucoup de témoignages dans ce sens. Une une autre une expérience de pensée que je que je conseille à tout le monde, à nous quatre, et réfléchissez entre le moment où vous vous levez le matin, vous vous réveillez, et le moment où vous vous endormez. Combien de fois êtes-vous dans une situation dans laquelle une IA pourrait apporter quoi que ce soit ? C'est rare. C'est rare. Il y a de temps en temps, nous avons un problème de pour, je sais pas, de nous déplacer d'un endroit à l'autre parce que euh ben, je sais pas, le RER est en est en panne. Donc, nous devons effectivement résoudre un problème, et là, l'IA va nous permettre va nous aider. Mais dans beaucoup de situations, on voit pas très bien quel est le problème à résoudre d'une certaine façon. C'est du coup notre attitude dans ce qui se passe d'un moment à l'autre de la journée. Donc, je pense que l'IA est très très loin n'est n'est pas dans la course en quelque sorte pour nous remplacer. En revanche, évidemment, il y a un certain nombre de métiers où elle fournit on fait en 10 minutes une ligne de code simple, on fait en 10 minutes une traduction d'une langue qu'on ne connaît pas, et cetera. Ça, évidemment, c'est tout à fait vrai. Mais fondamentalement, dans d'innombrables fonctions, l'IA n'a pas d'aide à nous apporter. Hmm hmm.\n",

      "        En fait, on utilise de l'IA au quotidien partout. D'accord. Alors, je suis pas du tout d'accord avec ce point de vue. De plus, les gens parlent alors aux agents conversationnels le matin. On a accès aussi pour des choses autour de nous qui représentaient du travail, on va résumer des choses, c'était des gens qui le faisaient, on a accès à des informations directes. On déverrouille son portable avec la reconnaissance vocale du visage. C'est c'est terrible de dire que on est très loin de ça et moi je suis absolument pas d'accord. On est au quotidien avec des outils partout d'IA et on se rend pas compte de leur capacité. On fantasme. Alors, moi aussi, je pense que ayant beaucoup travaillé sur les émotions et sur la modélisation des émotions dans les machines, que on est très loin en fait de comprendre l'humain. Donc, il y a aussi une espèce de fantasmagorie à penser que ça va aller inciter dans l'inconscient précisément. Par exemple, je reprends aussi le Lacan puisque je travaille aussi avec des Lacaniens en ce moment, les mécanismes d'inconscient comme le refoulement, l'ambivalence, la condensation, le déplacement, ils sont des opérations langagières assez précises où ça demande des nuances, de la détection des émotions fines. On parle par exemple de d'avoir peur des chiens et en fait, c'est parce que ça a un rapport à son père et le psychanalyste est capable de comprendre des rapports entre des choses qui sont totalement pas dites dans le langage, comme les silences aussi, enfin tout ces lapsus sont totalement incompris par ses machines. Donc on a l'impression de se confier à des machines et qu'elles ont un haut niveau capable d'impacter notre inconscient. Elles vont impacter parce qu'elles vont nous isoler, elles vont nous répéter des tas de choses. Ça, c'est sûr, mais elles ne comprennent rien. de l'inconscient des gens. Absolument pas. Le psyché des gens, leur est totalement fermé. Et pour avoir travaillé et trop plus haut niveau sur l'état de l'art de ces systèmes en détection des émotions et en interprétation ce qu'il en est, il y a une telle dis- différence entre les êtres humains, il y a tellement d'enjeux multimodaux parce que ça passe par le corps, la respiration, tout un tas de choses que la machine n'a pas encore vu. Maintenant, il y a des recherches là-dessus. Donc, demain, on aura des machines, on essaiera d'avoir une modélisation émotionnelle à l'intérieur avec plaisir, des plaisirs, souffrance, et puis la machine, on va faire en sorte qu'elle ait des intentions. Mais tout ça, c'est encore une mécanique que des ingénieurs essaient de mettre. Il y a le Gakin, j'ai Méta, a des projets comme cela. Donc, les des Japonais ou des Chinois dans des laboratoires ont des projets comme cela. Mais aujourd'hui, ça n'existe pas et aujourd'hui, par contre, ça a une influence sur nous. On parle de coévolution humain-machine un peu partout, et je pense qu'il faut absolument regarder ce qu'elle est et ce qu'elle fait sur nos comportements. Moi, je veux qu'on fasse de la recherche là-dessus à beaucoup plus haut niveau et qu'on ne délègue pas en disant : \"Oh là là, c'est pas important, ça n'arrivera pas.\"\n",
